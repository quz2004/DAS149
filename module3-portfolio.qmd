# Module 3 Overview

::: {.fragment}

- You already did the **hard work**: built an app, digitized Nightingale's diagram, and made the plot.

- Today is about turning that work into a **public story** and a **personal brand asset**.

- By the end of class, you will have:
  - A GitHub repo with your Nightingale project
  - A clear, readable README
  - A simple personal **logo** generated with AI
  - Your project **pinned** on your GitHub profile

:::


# Goals for Today

::: {.fragment}

- Get comfortable using **Git + GitHub with SSH** (no fear of the terminal).

- Publish your **first real portfolio project**.

- Practice **data storytelling** in your README.

- Design and generate a **personal logo** with Gemini 3 Pro in Antigravity.

:::


# Assumptions

::: {.fragment}

- You already have:
  - Nightingale digitization app code
  - Computed data (CSV / JSON)
  - Final rose diagram PNG

- Python and Antigravity are installed and working on your machine.

- We will check and install Git together at the start of class.

:::


# Act 1 — Big Picture

## Why Portfolios Matter

::: {.fragment}

- Recruiters and mentors want to see **evidence**, not just course names.

- A clean GitHub repo with a strong README is your **visible track record**.

- Today you create your **first "anchor" project**: something you can show proudly.

:::


## Nightingale as a Portfolio Piece

::: {.fragment}

- You solved a real historical data problem and built a full pipeline.

- The project shows:
  - Coding
  - Visualization
  - Use of data to tell a **story about change**

- Now we make that legible to others.

:::


# Act 2 — GitHub Setup with SSH

## Step 0 — Check If Git Is Installed

::: {.fragment}

- Before we set up SSH, we must be sure Git is installed.

- We will:
  - Ask Antigravity how to check for Git.
  - Run the check command.
  - If needed, ask Antigravity to guide us through installation (Mac or Windows).

:::


## Prompt 0 — Check Git (Any OS)

```text
I am a beginner on [macOS or Windows].

Help me check whether Git is already installed.

Give me:
1) A one-sentence explanation of what we are checking.
2) The exact command I should type to check the Git version.
```

::: {.fragment}

- Type the suggested command in your terminal and press Enter.

- If you see a version like `git version 2.x.x`, you already have Git — skip to Prompt 1.

- If you get an error, raise your hand.

:::


## If Git Is Not Installed — macOS

::: {.fragment}

- On macOS, the simplest beginner-friendly option is:

  - Install **Xcode Command Line Tools**, which include Git.

- We will let Antigravity give us the exact command and explain it.

:::


## Prompt 0-mac — Install Git on macOS

```text
I am on macOS and the command to check `git --version` did not work.

I want the simplest, safest way to install Git using Apple's Command Line Tools.

Give me:
1) A short explanation of what we are about to do.
2) The exact command I should type to start the installation.
3) Any follow-up steps I should expect (such as clicking "Install" in a popup).
```

::: {.fragment}

- Type the command Antigravity gives you (likely `xcode-select --install`).

- A popup will appear — click **Install** and wait.

- When done, run the Git version check again to confirm.

:::


## If Git Is Not Installed — Windows

::: {.fragment}

- On Windows, you have two beginner options:

  - **GUI installer** from git-scm.com (recommended for most students)
  - **winget** command in PowerShell (faster if available)

:::


## Prompt 0-win — Install Git on Windows

```text
I am on Windows and the command to check `git --version` did not work.

Give me two beginner-friendly options to install Git:

1) Using the official Git for Windows installer (GUI):
   - Tell me what website to open.
   - Tell me what to click.
   - Tell me what choices to make in the installer.

2) Using the winget command in PowerShell:
   - Tell me the exact `winget install` command.
   - Explain briefly what it does.
```

::: {.fragment}

- Follow the option that matches your setup.

- When done, open a **new** PowerShell window and run the Git version check again.

:::


## Step 1 — Create Your GitHub Account

::: {.fragment}

- Go to <https://github.com>.

- Choose a **professional username**:
  - Use your real name or a clean variant if possible.
  - Avoid jokes or references you will regret later.

- Add:
  - Your full name
  - A simple profile picture
  - Your location / school

:::


## SSH Setup — Workflow

::: {.fragment}

- We will:
  - Generate an SSH key on your machine.
  - Add the public key to GitHub.
  - Test the connection.

- Terminal on the left, Antigravity on the right.

- You **type every command**, but Antigravity explains it.

:::


## Prompt 1 — Generate SSH Key

```text
I am a beginner setting up GitHub. 

What is GitHub in one simple sentence, and what is the first command I should run to generate a new SSH key? 

Give me:
1) One short explanation sentence
2) The exact command on its own line
```

::: {.fragment}

- Read the explanation.

- Type the command in your terminal and press Enter.

- When done, raise your hand if you see a message about the key being created.

:::


## Prompt 2 — Start SSH Agent

```text
I just generated my SSH key. 

What is the next command I should run to start the SSH agent, and what does it do? 

Again:
1) One short explanation
2) The exact command on its own line
```

::: {.fragment}

- Copy the command from Antigravity.

- Type it in your terminal (do **not** paste from Antigravity).

- Press Enter and check for success.

:::


## Prompt 3 — Add Key to Agent

```text
Now I need to add my new SSH key to the SSH agent. 

Explain what the command does, then give the command.
```

::: {.fragment}

- Type the command to add your key.

- If you see an error, raise your hand — we will debug together.

:::


## Prompt 4 — Copy Public Key

```text
How do I see my public SSH key so I can copy it into GitHub?

Explain briefly, then give the command.
```

::: {.fragment}

- Run the `cat` command Antigravity gives you.

- Carefully select and copy the full key from your terminal.

- In GitHub:
  - Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
  - Paste and save.

:::


## Prompt 5 — Test Connection

```text
How do I test that my SSH connection to GitHub is working?

Explain in one sentence, then give the command.
```

::: {.fragment}

- Run the test command.

- You should see a message like: **"Hi _your-username_! You've successfully authenticated."**

- When you see your username in the message, pause and smile.

:::


## Checkpoint 1

::: {.fragment}

- You now have:
  - A GitHub account.
  - A working SSH connection.

- This is a **big professional milestone**.

- Take 5 seconds to appreciate it.

:::


# Act 3 — Create the Nightingale Repo

## Local Folder and Repo

```text
I want to create a new project folder called 'nightingale-rose' on my computer, initialize it as a git repository, and connect it to a new GitHub repo called 'nightingale-rose' that I already created in the browser. 

Give me one command at a time, in order. For each command:
1) Briefly explain what it does
2) Then show the command
I will say 'next' when I'm ready.
```

::: {.fragment}

- We will advance through these commands together.

- Everyone pauses between commands so no one is left behind.

:::


## Expected Structure

::: {.fragment}

- Inside `nightingale-rose/`, you should eventually have:

  - `README.md`  
  - `data/` (JSON / CSV from previous class)  
  - `src/` (your Python scripts)  
  - `output/` (your final PNG)  
  - `assets/` (original Nightingale image, logo)

- For now, create `README.md` (empty is fine).

:::


# Act 4 — Writing the Data Story

## README Sections

::: {.fragment}

- Your README will have:

  - Title and one-sentence summary  
  - The historical story  
  - How the data was collected  
  - The math and visualization  
  - Key insights  
  - Technical details  
  - How to run  
  - References

- We'll build this **section by section**.

:::


## Section 1 — Title and Summary

::: {.fragment}

- Open `README.md` in your editor.

- Add:

  - A clear title, e.g.:  
    `# Florence Nightingale's Rose Diagram — A Replication`

  - A one-sentence summary in your own words.

:::


## Prompt 6 — Historical Context

```text
Write a 3-sentence opening paragraph for a data science portfolio README about Florence Nightingale's rose diagram. 

Mention:
- The Crimean War
- The sanitary reform crisis
- How her visualization influenced British military policy

Write it in a clear, professional tone for a technical audience.
```

::: {.fragment}

- Paste the paragraph into a **"The Story"** section in your README.

- Edit at least one sentence to sound more like **your** voice.

:::


## Prompt 7 — How the Data Was Collected

```text
Write a 3-sentence paragraph for my README explaining how I collected the data for this project:

- I built a Python app that let me click 4 key points on each month in Nightingale's original diagram image.
- The app saved pixel coordinates as JSON.
- I then used Python to convert those coordinates into radii and proportional areas for different causes of death.

Write this in first person and make it understandable for someone new to data visualization.
```

::: {.fragment}

- Paste into a **"How the Data Was Collected"** section.

- Adjust details if your implementation differed.

:::


## Prompt 8 — Key Insights

```text
Write 3 bullet points for my README that explain what Florence Nightingale's rose diagram reveals:

1) One bullet about what the left diagram (before reforms) shows.
2) One bullet about what the right diagram (after reforms) shows.
3) One bullet about what this visualization demonstrates about data-driven policy change.

Keep each bullet to one sentence.
```

::: {.fragment}

- Paste into a **"Key Insights"** section.

- Add **one extra bullet of your own** based on your plot.

:::


## Reflection (No AI)

::: {.fragment}

- Add a **"What I Learned"** section.

- Write 2–3 sentences **without using AI**:

  - What did you learn technically?
  - What did you learn about data and society?

- This is your authentic voice.

:::


# Act 5 — Designing Your Logo

## Why a Logo?

::: {.fragment}

- A logo acts as a **visual anchor** for your identity.

- It doesn't need to be fancy:

  - Simple shapes
  - Initials
  - A small data-related icon

- The goal is to feel: **"This is mine."**

:::


## Option Templates

::: {.fragment}

- Choose **one** of these simple logo concepts:

  - **Monogram**: Your initials inside a circle or square, with a subtle data element.
  - **Data Icon**: A tiny bar chart, line chart, or node-link diagram with your initials.
  - **Nightingale Theme**: An abstract "rose" of radial bars plus your initials.

- Sketch a quick idea on paper (1–2 minutes).

:::


## Turning Design into a Prompt

::: {.fragment}

- Open Antigravity and start a new chat.

- Use this pattern and customize the [brackets]:

:::

```text
You are Gemini 3 Pro, acting as a logo designer.

Create a simple, flat, vector-style logo for a data science student.

Concept:
- [Describe your chosen option: monogram / data icon / Nightingale theme]
- Include my initials: [YOUR INITIALS]
- Style: minimal, high contrast, works well at small sizes
- Background: transparent
- Output format: SVG or high-resolution PNG

First, describe the logo you will generate in 2–3 sentences. Then generate it.
```


## Using the Logo

::: {.fragment}

- Save the logo file into your repo, e.g.:

  - `assets/logo.png` or `assets/logo.svg`

- In your README, add at the very top:

  - `![Logo](assets/logo.png)` (adjust path as needed)

- Optionally, set it as your repo's social preview image in GitHub settings.

:::


# Act 6 — Commit, Push, and Pin

## Prompt 9 — Stage and Commit

```text
I am ready to publish my project. 

Give me the git commands, one at a time, to:
1) See which files are changed.
2) Stage all files.
3) Write a good commit message for adding my Nightingale project and README.
4) Push to the main branch on GitHub.

Explain each command briefly.
```

::: {.fragment}

- Type each command.

- When asked for a commit message, use either the suggested one or your own.

:::


## Checkpoint 2 — Live on GitHub

::: {.fragment}

- Refresh your GitHub repo page.

- Confirm:

  - README is visible.
  - Image of the rose diagram displays.
  - Logo shows at the top.

- Share your repo URL with a neighbor.

:::


## Prompt 10 — Profile README

```text
Write a GitHub profile README for a college freshman studying data science.

Include:
- A short About Me (2–3 sentences)
- A Skills section (Python, matplotlib, data visualization, git)
- A Projects section linking to my 'nightingale-rose' repository
- A Currently Learning section

Use clean markdown and a professional but friendly tone.
```

::: {.fragment}

- Create a new repo named exactly your username.

- Add `README.md` with the generated content (and edit it).

- Add a bullet with a link to your Nightingale project.

:::


## Pin Your Project

::: {.fragment}

- On your GitHub profile:

  - Click **Customize your pins**.
  - Pin your `nightingale-rose` repo.

- This is now one of your **headline projects**.

:::


## GitHub Pages — Give Your Project a URL

::: {.fragment}

- Enable GitHub Pages so your project has a live web address:

  1. In your `nightingale-rose` repo → **Settings → Pages**
  2. Under **Source**, select `main` branch → click **Save**
  3. Your project will be live at:  
     `https://`**`your-username`**`.github.io/nightingale-rose/`

- Add this URL to:
  - Your repo's **About** description (top-right gear icon)
  - Your `README.md` (as a clickable link)

- Now anyone can visit your project — no GitHub account needed.

:::


# Wrap-Up

## What You Achieved Today

::: {.fragment}

- Set up a **professional GitHub account** with SSH.

- Turned a technical project into a **clear narrative**.

- Designed and generated a **personal logo**.

- Published, pinned, and **published live** your first data science portfolio project.

:::


## Homework (Light)
